# **Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction (README)**





#### 

#### **🎯 Objective**



**The primary objective of this project is to develop a binary classification model that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their medical health data. This task involves cleaning clinical data, performing exploratory analysis, and evaluating a machine learning model for medical diagnostic reliability.**

#### **📂 Dataset**



**Source: Heart Disease UCI Dataset (sourced from Kaggle).**





**Features: Includes medical metrics such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain type (cp), Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol), and Maximum Heart Rate (thalach).**

**+2**





**Target: Binary classification (0 = No Disease, 1 = Heart Disease).**



#### **🛠️ Skills \& Tools**



**Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and preparing features for binary classification.**

**+1**





**Statistical Analysis: Utilizing .describe() and .info() to understand medical data distributions.**

**+1**





**Modeling: Logistic Regression (selected for its interpretability in medical settings).**

**+2**





**Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC curve, and Feature Importance analysis.**

**+1**



#### **📈 Key Visualizations \& Analysis**



**Scatter Plots: Analyzed the relationship between Age and Cholesterol levels relative to the target variable.**

**+1**





**Confusion Matrix: Visualized the model's performance in terms of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.**

**+1**





**ROC Curve: Achieved a high AUC (Area Under the Curve) score, demonstrating the model's strong ability to distinguish between patients with and without disease.**

**+1**





**Feature Importance: Identified key medical drivers—such as maximum heart rate and chest pain type—that most significantly impact the prediction.**

**+2**



#### **Insights**



**Medical Correlation: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise (thalach) and chest pain types are among the most influential features in predicting heart risk.**

**+1**





**Model Performance: Logistic Regression proved to be an effective baseline for this dataset, providing a balance between accuracy and the transparency required for healthcare-related AI.**
