📄 **Task 1: Iris Species Visualization (README)**

Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization

🎯 **Objective**

The goal of this project is to load, inspect, and visualize the classic Iris dataset to understand the relationships between physical measurements (sepal and petal dimensions) and different flower species.



**🛠️ Skills \& Tools**

Pandas: Data loading, inspection (.head(), .info()), and summary statistics (.describe()).



Matplotlib \& Seaborn: Creating distribution plots and relationship visualizations.



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and patterns in data.



**📊 Key Visualizations**

Scatter Plots: Visualized the relationship between sepal length and width, showing how species cluster together.



Histograms: Analyzed the distribution and frequency of each feature.



Box Plots: Used to identify the range, median, and potential outliers in the measurements.



**💡 Insights**

Petal Measurements: Petal length and width provide a clearer separation between species than sepal measurements.



Species Clustering: Iris-setosa is highly distinct, while Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica show slight overlap in certain dimensions.
